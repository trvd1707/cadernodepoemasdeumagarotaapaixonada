                        I run far far away,<br>
                        To the infinite frontiers<br>
                        Where true pain<br>
                        Is the only limit<br>
                        To the dream.<br>
                        <br />

                        I run far far away,<br>
                        But every road<br>
                        Seems like an arc<br>
                        And all the roads together<br>
                        Bring me back.<br>
                        <br />

                        <br>
                        I run far far away,<br>
                        And my heart runs away with me,<br>
                        But my ears are attentive.<br>
                        Someone may cry.<br>
                        And need me.
