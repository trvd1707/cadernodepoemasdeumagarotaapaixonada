What is the force that makes you<br>
Fly so high, my son?<br>

Your soul is like a turbine<br>
That throws you into space.<br>

Among the stars you stay<br>
and let yourself wander<br>
Among the asteroids and comets.<br>

my screams are not enough<br>
To bring you back.<br>

They are like the wind blowing<br>
In your billowing sails.<br>

They push you even further!<br>
<br>
- Go back? For what?<br>

What you show me is so bad...<br>

Look, mom!<br>

What I have here, among my stars,<br>
Is much better.<br>

Only here in space I can<br>
Open wide all my loneliness</p>
