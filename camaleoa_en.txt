                      
                        CHAMELEON
                      
                      
                        And one would say of her:
                        
                        - She is like a chameleon,
                        Sometimes saying yes and sometimes saying no.
                        
                        However, I am just a child,
                        Sometimes smiling and sometimes resting.
                        
                        You may think I am mysterious,
                        Because sometimes I am simple and sometimes pompous.
                        
                        To you I say that I am just some random coincidence.
                        
                        I am not your mystery, I am your woman.
