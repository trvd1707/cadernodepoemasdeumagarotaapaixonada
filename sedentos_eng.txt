                        
                          THIRSTY FOR LOVE
                        
                        
                          Two lovers like this,
                          thirsty for love,
                          produce the most beautiful scenes.
                          
                          Their gaze is always lost,
                          floating in unsatisfied desires.
                          When they meet,
                          they emit bursts
                          of lust and passion.
                          
                          And they charge themselves with positive charges
                          When they touch each other like this,
                          so electrically.
                          
                          They are like batteries
                          that slowly discharge.
                          
                          They are all colors together,
                          mixed
                          without getting confused.
