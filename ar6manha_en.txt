THE AIR AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING

In the air at six o'clock in the morning
Something different hovers
A fragrant coolness
That colors the world
In smoky white.

The air at six o'clock in the morning
Is infinitely pleasant.
It gets me out of bed
It cools my feet
It reminds me of life
It brings me coffee

In the air at six o'clock in the morning
There is something that sings
Something that awakens
Like a flower that blooms
Crowned with dew
At six o'clock in the morning.

The air at six o'clock in the morning
Disperses the sun that wakes
As if it were going to sleep
And brings a brightness
Weakly intense
That cools me
Instead of warming me.

In the air at six o'clock in the morning
The warm dreams of the night
Rise...Cool up high
And descend in the form of mist.

The six o'clock morning air
Condenses the stars,
Bright vapors
From the darkness of the sky,
In the form of dew
That covers the earth
Like a veil.

In the six o'clock morning air,
With its song of birds,
Its perfume of flowery dew,
Its sparse colors of mist,
I feel flashes of joy
And make plans of happiness
