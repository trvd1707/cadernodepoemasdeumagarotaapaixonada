 To the wedding couple
Everything around them loves.
And all of nature
That colorfully 
Gifts them with happiness
Is nothing but
A divine crystalline mirror
That reflects their love.

May this mirror of happiness
Always be clear,
So that the they can look at themselves in it
Forever.

May their love
Make them present
In infinity.

I send these couple
Many, many hugs,
So that they may keep
My dreams and theirs.
