    DETACHMENT

I will never be hurt
If in all the moments of your life
You never feel unhappy.

May you sleep satisfied
In the arms of the woman
That is tender to you.

I will be truly hurt
If you spend the night brooding,
Conquered by the anguish
Sung in the songbooks,
Suffered by the romantics,
Mocked by the realists...
The symbolic force
Of the modernist poets.

I will always be dear to you
If you love me forever by your side.
Away from me, don't even think!
Dream, always laugh.
Live! So your happy life
will be my dream of love
