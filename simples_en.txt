SIMPLE

What makes me the same as everyone else
Is trying to do things differently
Trying to live in the present
Thinking about the future that is not there.

What makes me elegant
Is dressing myself in a rush,
With the idea that I invent.
Is dressing myself in the moment
And adorning myself with the instant.

That's how I make myself.
That's how I draw myself.
In that aura of happiness.

Created so alone
And only
By that simplicity.
