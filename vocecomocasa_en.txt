                      
                        YOU ARE LIKE A HOUSE
                      
                      
                        You are like a house
                        That I walk through for the first time.
                        Its wooden floors
                        Creaking strange noises.
                        Not like that hallway,
                        Down which I always walked,
                        Whose sounds, from hearing them so much,
                        No longer bother me.
                        
                        The first time I walk through you
                        And everything is so dark and unknown!
                        
                        I wanted to be very close to you.
                        So close
                        That I could embrace your soul!
                        
                        Running my hands gently
                        Over your scars,
                        Kissing your wounds,
                        Breathing your sweat...
                        Like this, very close,
                        Very close...
                        Coming... Coming...
                        coming... coming...
                        Staying inside you.
