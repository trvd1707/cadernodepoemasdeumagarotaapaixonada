         WHEN I SAW YOU

(Dear Diary)

One day, love happened to me.

I felt that love is falling asleep happily
In the hope that dawn will soon arrive.

(Just to see you!)

Every morning,
When the sun comes in through the window
And makes the room shine with light,
I always remember the morning of my life,
When a ray of love,
Bringing your image,
Penetrated my heart
And lit up my path with happiness.

And I hear your voice
That rocks me like a gentle breeze
Rocks the leaves,
Soothing the summer.

You appeared in my life
Like the moon
That descends from the sky to embrace the sea,
Shedding its kiss that covers the water in silver,
Celebrating every night the lovely encounter.

For me, you are the embrace of a friend,
The tender smile of a child,
The ardent kiss of a lover,
The beloved,
The complement.

And the starry night
That hides beneath your eyes...
It fascinates me and consumes me,
It makes me your slave.

Then I know that I love you
And that is enough for me.
