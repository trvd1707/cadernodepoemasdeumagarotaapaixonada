                        THIRSTY FOR LOVE II


                        (a fugue)

                        How sad the life of lovers is!
                        They have no past, no future.
                        They make no plans
                        and live on crumbs,
                        in fits and starts.
                        They have neither themselves,
                        nor the other.
                        They only have a desire and a love
                        that evaporates
                        and fades away...
                        away...
                        away...
                        away
