                        I love you<br>
                        And my love for you<br>
                        Is like the winter<br>
                        That confines me to warm clothes<br>
                        And blankets<br>
                        And surrounds and invades me<br>
                        As soon as an opportunity arises.<br>
                        <br>
                        The cold that accompanies you here,<br>
                        So far from me,<br>
                        Stays here too,<br>
                        Like a silent sentinel.<br>

                        It's a nostalgic way<br>
                        Of having you by my side<br>
                        While you're so far away.<br>
                        <br>
                        I love you.<br></p>
