                      
                        THE MOTHER AND THE CHILD
                      
                      

                        The mother loves the child
                        The sun shines on the child's face
                        The sun shines on the mother's face
                        But the mother loves the child.
                        
                        If the mother could take the sun for herself
                        She would take it far away
                        Where it would no longer shine
                        On the face of the child so young!
                        
                        But the mother cannot.
                        The mother loves the child
                        And stands there
                        With the sun on her face
                        And on the face of the child
                        
                        (If someone is capable
                        Of loving the mother of the child and the child
                        they will offer these two
                        A place in the shade)
