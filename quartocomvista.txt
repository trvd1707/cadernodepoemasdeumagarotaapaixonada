                      To Oleg and Tamara Greshner
                      
                        In front of my window
                        There is a rose bush of white roses.
                        As I look out,
                        The white roses simply exist,
                        Swaying gently.
                        
                        I smile at the white roses
                        Looking out the window.
                        Whose window is it,
                        Mine or theirs?
