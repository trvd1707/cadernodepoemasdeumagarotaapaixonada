Acknowledgements

My first book. So many people to thank... Rogério Lacaz-Ruiz did an excellent job, reviewing each poem, making corrections and offering intelligent suggestions. My family always encouraged me to keep writing. I thank my mother, my brothers and sisters. I thank my grandmother Alzira who taught me to tell stories, my grandmother Otília, who taught me to be determined, my grandfather Ivo, who always wanted to hear my stories and my father, my guardian angel, who was always by my side in the most difficult times.

I thank my friends. There may not be many, but they are all very dear.

I thank Chris, who supports me with his love and affection.

I thank my children, my main source of inspiration, my reason for being.

Some poems were read by Mauro Castro, who in addition to being an excellent actor and voice actor is a wonderful friend.
