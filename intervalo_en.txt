TIME LAPSE

Suddenly I thought
Of everything I had lived
I thought of what I could.
I thought of channeling
All the movement
In an eloquent gesture of love.

Love...
Suddenly I touched your body.
I became aware of your love
Through my reciprocity.
And I loved this white distance
That separates me from reality.

I wanted to throw the fire of my body
To corrupt itself in your abrasive pleasure.
I wanted the common dream to be sincere.
And that through us emanated
Offspring, forms of life, philosophy, happiness,
Anthologies, atrocities...
"Study of the dimorphism of some useless words"

All in a single instant.

Suddenly I looked out the window
I imagined that everything was true
And I created the right convenience
For all the words.
Thus, all the lies were erased.
In a single instant I thought everything and lived nothing.
