                      LAND AND SEA
                       
                      
                        The real border between sea and land
                        Is not the midpoint of the waves,
                        Nor the white line of foam
                        That can be seen from above.
                        
                        The line that truly separates them, sea and land,
                        Passes through the point where the spirit
                        Begins to abandon the body
                        And the body fills with water.
                        It is the curve of the points
                        Where souls fly away,
                        Following the ocean currents
                        To reach other beaches... Other seas...
                        
                        The land ends where the dream begins.
                        Where the journey begins
                        "To the edge of another place"
                        The sea begins.
                        
                        There, where the waves mutate staticly,
                        Where body and water are married,
                        Where everything happens in an eternal instant,
                        Everything indefinable, indefatigable,
                        there the land ends and the sea begins...
