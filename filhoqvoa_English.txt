                        How can I reach my son who can fly?
                        <br>
                        How can I?
                        <br>
                        Ah! At least touch lightly
                        <br>
                        The fringe of his soul...
                        <br>
                        Could a heart,<br>
                        Tortured like mine,
                        <br>
                        Desire to go so high?
                        <br>
                        A soul so wrinkled,
                        <br>
                        Could want to brush
                        <br>
                        This purity of feathers
                        <br>
                        Of another so renewed?
                        <br>
                        Flying... Flying...
                        <br>
                        Flying just for the pleasure of the wind
                        <br>
                        Tingling the hairs on my skin...
                        <br>
                        Flying for the desire to fly,
                        <br>
                        Because his fate is to fly.<br>
                        <br>
                        I have a son who can fly.<br>
                        </p>
