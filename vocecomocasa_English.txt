                        You are like a house<br>
                        That I walk through for the first time.<br>
                        Its wooden floors<br>
                        Creaking strange noises.<br>
                        Not like that hallway,<br>
                        Down which I always walked,<br>
                        Whose sounds, from hearing them so much,<br>
                        No longer bother me.<br>
                        <br>
                        The first time I walk through you<br>
                        And everything is so dark and unknown!<br>
                        <br>
                        I wanted to be very close to you.<br>
                        So close<br>
                        That I could embrace your soul!<br>
                        <br>
                        Running my hands gently<br>
                        Over your scars,<br>
                        Kissing your wounds,<br>
                        Breathing your sweat...<br>
                        Like this, very close,<br>
                        Very close...<br>
                        Coming... Coming...<br>
                        coming... coming...<br>
                        Staying inside you.<br>
                        </p>
