                      
                        VIGIL
                      
                      
                      
                        I run far far away,
                        To the infinite frontiers
                        Where true pain
                        Is the only limit
                        To the dream.
                        

                        I run far far away,
                        But every road
                        Seems like an arc
                        And all the roads together
                        Bring me back.
                        

                        
                        I run far far away,
                        And my heart runs away with me,
                        But my ears are attentive.
                        Someone may cry.
                        And need me.
