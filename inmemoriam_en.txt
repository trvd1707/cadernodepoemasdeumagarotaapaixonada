                      
                        IN MEMORIAM
                      
                      
                        I write my poems
                        Because soon
                        Only they will remain
                        
                        No one will delight
                        In my honor
                        But my poems will be there
                        Proving that I existed
                        
                        They are my portraits,
                        From the inside out,
                        They are my story,
                        My life.
                        
                        They are what my eyes saw
                        What my body felt
                        What my soul desired.
                        
                        When time comes that my children and grandchildren
                        Want to forget me
                        The poems that are written
                        Will alert them
                        That I was a woman,
                        And I fell in love.
