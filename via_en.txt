VIA

When life cries
Tears are sighs.
We hear them everywhere.

Hearts groan all around.
Souls are squeezed in the streets.
You suck it up and say:

- So what?

And these sorrows?
Are they yours?
Mine? Ours?

They are not ours.
We are multiple.
Plural individuals,
But we are one.

Only you, only you...
You and your spirit
Reign in the anguish
That depresses you.

That is why you oppress
The one you see
And the one you do not believe in.

Insensitive!
You only believe in the invisible.

Look at life and stop!
Listen to these sighs
And lament with it.

May sunlight make you cry
And your tears will be stars.
