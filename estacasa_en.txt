      THIS HOUSE

(To do list)

This house, my house
That I love so much.
The loose parquet floors,
The corroded boards,
The rusty plumbing,
The leaks when it rains,
The bats in the chimney...

Every corner
That I've ever imagined...
What would it have,
What to do...
What will it be like?

When I have time,
I swear I'll fix it!

Now that I have
All the time in the world,
I can't keep the house anymore.

I'll box up my dreams,
Wrap up my plans
And I'll keep in my memory
The sunlight
Resting on the porch.
The creaking of the hammock,
The smell of the garden.

The many shades of green
Of the tops of my trees
Intertwining with the vines
And swaying in the wind.
Ah! Everything will be
Like a big puzzle
With more than ten thousand little pieces. And my longing will be so great
That many of them will be lost...
I will never be able to
Reassemble it completely.

Pain makes our memory
I m p r e c i s e

The broken glass in the front,
The curtain rail,
Here is missing a sideboard,
So many little things are missing.

Some pictures to hang,
Films to develop,
Seedlings to plant.
I need to buy some pots!

And this old sash window?
Who will fix it?
Ah! If this house were mine
I would take out the tiles in the bathrooms.
I would put in a more decent floor
And tiles up to the ceiling.

I will still have to paint
These walls!
I wonder if I could change the color?
A screen would look good here,
Maybe made of silk,
With Chinese designs.
This garage door
Isn't really any good,
I'll just have to put in another one.
I think that's why
I always forget
The car outside, on the street.

Why is it this way?
The left side of the house doesn't have any faucets!
It needs a light source in the back,
on the other street,
to install a doorbell.
It would be good to have another gate,
just for pedestrians.

There's a hole in the yard,
the hole under the stairs needs to be closed.
There are ants, caterpillars,
and Gabriela, the mother lizard,
with her huge brood,
fighting over insects with the spiders.
(Will the manac√° tree resist?)

There are so many loose ends
in this tangle of threads...

I'll be very sorry
when I leave this house.
