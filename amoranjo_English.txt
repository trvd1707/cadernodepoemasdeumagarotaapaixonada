                        In this moment of doubts<br>
                        I come to beg you,<br>
                        Tender being that floods my body,<br>
                        That you do not question me with your yearnings.<br>
                        <br>
                        That you do not provoke me with your desires.<br>
                        <br>
                        You know, you know well,<br>
                        That I choose you.<br>
                        <br>
                        Even if you tear me<br>
                        From my infamous, insipid,<br>
                        Inert, inglorious, painless life<br>
                        And sustain me insolently<br>
                        And abandon me indolent<br>
                        In the distance, in time,<br>
                        Perhaps late,<br>
                        In the insane stream<br>
                        That consumes me shapeless</p>
