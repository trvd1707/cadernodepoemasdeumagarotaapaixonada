                          Two lovers like this,<br>
                          thirsty for love,<br>
                          produce the most beautiful scenes.<br>
                          <br>
                          Their gaze is always lost,<br>
                          floating in unsatisfied desires.<br>
                          When they meet,<br>
                          they emit bursts<br>
                          of lust and passion.<br>
                          <br>
                          And they charge themselves with positive charges<br>
                          When they touch each other like this,<br>
                          so electrically.<br>
                          <br>
                          They are like batteries<br>
                          that slowly discharge.<br>
                          <br>
                          They are all colors together,<br>
                          mixed<br>
                          without getting confused.<br></p>
