                        The mother loves the child<br>
                        The sun shines on the child's face<br>
                        The sun shines on the mother's face<br>
                        But the mother loves the child.<br>
                        <br>
                        If the mother could take the sun for herself<br>
                        She would take it far away<br>
                        Where it would no longer shine<br>
                        On the face of the child so young!<br>
                        <br>
                        But the mother cannot.<br>
                        The mother loves the child<br>
                        And stands there<br>
                        With the sun on her face<br>
                        And on the face of the child<br>
                        <br>
                        (If someone is capable
                        Of loving the mother of the child and the child
                        they will offer these two
                        A place in the shade)
