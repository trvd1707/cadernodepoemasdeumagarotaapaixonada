                        MY SON WHO FLIES


                        How can I reach my son who can fly?
                        How can I?
                        Ah! At least touch lightly
                        The fringe of his soul...
                        Could a heart,
                        Tortured like mine,
                        Desire to go so high?
                        A soul so wrinkled,
                        Could want to brush
                        This purity of feathers
                        Of another so renewed?
                        Flying... Flying...
                        Flying just for the pleasure of the wind
                        Tingling the hairs on my skin...
                        Flying for the desire to fly,
                        Because his fate is to fly.

                        I have a son who can fly.
