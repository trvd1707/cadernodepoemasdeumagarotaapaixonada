                        Poor Adriana!<br>
                        <br>
                        So young... Only twenty years old!<br>
                        And already so dead.<br>
                        <br>
                        All for a thoughtless act<br>
                        So common at this age.<br>
                        <br>
                        How many of us have done<br>
                        At least one thoughtless act<br>
                        Up until we were twenty years old?<br>
                        [and then regretted it...]<br>
                        <br>
                        But with her it all happened so fast.<br>
                        She didn't have time to regret.<br>
                        She didn't have time to learn<br>
                        In all her short existence.<br>
                        <br>
                        Poor Adriana!<br>
                        I don't even know if she was happy.<br>
                        She only had time to be pretty.<br>
                        And now,<br>
                        Not even her beauty is left.<br></p>
