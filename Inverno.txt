                        WINTER
                        I love you
                        And my love for you
                        Is like the winter
                        That confines me to warm clothes
                        And blankets
                        And surrounds and invades me
                        As soon as an opportunity arises.
                        The cold that accompanies you here,
                        So far from me,
                        Stays here too,
                        Like a silent sentinel.
                        It's a nostalgic way
                        Of having you by my side
                        While you're so far away.
                        I love you.
