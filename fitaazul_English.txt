We are each boats<br>
That sail through biological spaces<br>
<br>
Walk, walk. Stroll and wander unhappily<br>
While I await you. I am a pier.<br>
With a blue ribbon<br>
I will tie you to my mast.<br>
<br>
A blue ribbon bow...<br>
<br>
You are a boat, I am a boat.<br>
What color is the ribbon you keep for me?<br>
What is the knot?<br>
And I leave the boat in your lap.<br>
<br>
If the knot comes loose,<br>
The currents will carry you away.<br>
On which beach will you stay?<br>
If you went with the currents,<br>
what wind will bring you back?<br>
<br>
The blue ribbon swaying in the wind...<br>
And I think: "I wish I were a sandbank",<br>
You would be stranded and sleep there<br>
Without the blue ribbon bow.<br>
<br></p>
