Foreword
Throughout my life, I think like everyone else, I have always written poems. Also like most people, I never thought they were worth sharing with others. Until one day, Lucia, my housekeeper, asked me to write a love letter that she wanted to submit to a radio contest. Writing a love letter to a computer programmer is something of a challenge. Not wanting to disappoint her, I searched through my scribbles, poems that I had written during my adolescence. I found something that looked like a declaration of love. I changed the wording a little, so that it sounded more like a letter, and gave it to her. A few days later, she excitedly told me that she had won the contest with my "letter."

The episode made me think that perhaps other people would be interested in what I had written. So I began to collect the poems that I had written and type them on the computer. Many years have passed since then, but still, beneath the computer professional there is a passionate girl (thank God!). A girl who fell in love with human nature and the countless possibilities we have as people.
