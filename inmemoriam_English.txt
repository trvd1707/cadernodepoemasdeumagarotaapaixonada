                        I write my poems<br>
                        Because soon<br>
                        Only they will remain<br>
                        <br>
                        No one will delight<br>
                        In my honor<br>
                        But my poems will be there<br>
                        Proving that I existed<br>
                        <br>
                        They are my portraits,<br>
                        From the inside out,<br>
                        They are my story,<br>
                        My life.<br>
                        <br>
                        They are what my eyes saw<br>
                        What my body felt<br>
                        What my soul desired.<br>
                        <br>
                        When time comes that my children and grandchildren<br>
                        Want to forget me<br>
                        The poems that are written<br>
                        Will alert them<br>
                        That I was a woman,<br>
                        And I fell in love.<br></p>
