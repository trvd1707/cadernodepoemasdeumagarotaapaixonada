I MISS YOU, MY LOVE, I MISS YOU!

Sometimes I go inside myself
And cry... I cry.
It's longing!
I miss you so much.
I know I'll spend
My whole life
Deceiving myself.
I'll spend
My whole life
Hiding inside myself
To cry over the longing
I feel for you.

Crying...
Until I'm drenched in tears.
To drown my desire.
To think that all of this is ridiculous.
To deceive myself once more.
