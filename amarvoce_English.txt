Loving you<br>
Is something that will stay with me<br>
forever.<br>
<br>
Even if it's impossible to talk to you<br>
Even if it's unlikely to look at you<br>
Even if I always have to be silent...<br>
<br>
Still, loving you<br>
Is the idea with which I hope<br>
To cozy up my old age.<br>
<br>
Like a scarf<br>
Fluttering my memories<br>
in the wind.<br>
<br>
Loving you<br>
Sitting on a chair in the sun...<br>
<br>
Loving you<br>
In the loneliest moments of the night.<br>
<br>
Forever...<br>
Loving you...<br>
