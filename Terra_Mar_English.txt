                        The real border between sea and land<br>
                        Is not the midpoint of the waves,<br>
                        Nor the white line of foam<br>
                        That can be seen from above.<br>
                        <br>
                        The line that truly separates them, sea and land,<br>
                        Passes through the point where the spirit<br>
                        Begins to abandon the body<br>
                        And the body fills with water.<br>
                        It is the curve of the points<br>
                        Where souls fly away,<br>
                        Following the ocean currents<br>
                        To reach other beaches... Other seas...<br>
                        <br>
                        The land ends where the dream begins.<br>
                        Where the journey begins<br>
                        "To the edge of another place"<br>
                        The sea begins.<br>
                        <br>
                        There, where the waves mutate staticly,<br>
                        Where body and water are married,<br>
                        Where everything happens in an eternal instant,<br>
                        Everything indefinable, indefatigable,<br>
                        there the land ends and the sea begins... <br>
