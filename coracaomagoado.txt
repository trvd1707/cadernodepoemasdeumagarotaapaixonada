                        BROKEN HEART



                        It is very difficult to understand
                        A woman's broken heart.
                        It is very difficult to understand passion.
                        It confuses the senses,
                        It drives away sense and reason.
                        It is at the same time superficial and intense.

                        Passion is like mothballs
                        In dull spirits.
                        It impregnates with odors
                        Our motives and destinies,
                        While it evaporates
                        Madly and quickly.
