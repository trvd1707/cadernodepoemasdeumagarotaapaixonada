                      
                        Pink Trumpet Tree 
                        
The tip of a branch from the pink trumpet tree
That keeps peeking at me
In the window corner.

When it is in bloom
I smile.
When it is full of leaves
I think.
When it is dry
I feel such great anguish!

Such is our vanity.
