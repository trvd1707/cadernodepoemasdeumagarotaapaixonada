                      
                        THE IRRESISTIBLE WISH TO FLY
                        
                      
                      
What is the force that makes you
Fly so high, my son?

Your soul is like a turbine
That throws you into space.

Among the stars you stay
and let yourself wander
Among the asteroids and comets.

my screams are not enough
To bring you back.

They are like the wind blowing
In your billowing sails.

They push you even further!

- Go back? For what?

What you show me is so bad...

Look, mom!

What I have here, among my stars,
Is much better.

Only here in space I can
Open wide all my loneliness
