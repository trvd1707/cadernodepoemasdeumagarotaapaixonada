             VIA LESTE

(More than four years living in SJC and working in SP!)

I like my road
On the eve of the holidays.
That volume of cars
With their headlights on,
It's as if it were dressed for a party.
Like a loose woman...
Scoundrel,
Getting goosebumps with the tires
Scratching the asphalt.

I try to argue
That this isn't right.
What will they say
When a more daring one
Writhes in an orgasm
(the last one!)
Amidst blood and wreckage?
It will be her, the road, for sure,
The one to blame.

But she, she doesn't even care,
Keeps on like this,
Animal,
Dragging these battalions
That will dump their neuroses
On the beaches and mountains.

Deep down it's my jealousy...
This road that is almost only mine
Every night,
Now it's there,
Bitch,
For anyone.

Ah! How I have grown accustomed
To burying my steel body
In its darkness!
And it, thirsty, sucking up my solitude,
Muffling my noises,
Confidant of my laments.

Even so,
I like this rabble a little.
Because all of them,
Rolling around me,
Do not regard it as I do.
As my sustenance,
my work.
As my life
And my death
