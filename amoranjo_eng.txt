                      
                        LOVE
                      
                      (Like Augusto dos
                        Anjos)
                        
                      
                      
                        In this moment of doubts
                        I come to beg you,
                        Tender being that floods my body,
                        That you do not question me with your yearnings.
                        
                        That you do not provoke me with your desires.
                        
                        You know, you know well,
                        That I choose you.
                        
                        Even if you tear me
                        From my infamous, insipid,
                        Inert, inglorious, painless life
                        And sustain me insolently
                        And abandon me indolent
                        In the distance, in time,
                        Perhaps late,
                        In the insane stream
                        That consumes me shapeless
