I want your affection,<br>
Even if it's fake<br>
So I won't be alone<br>
<br>
I want affection<br>
And it's good that it's you<br>
Because you're beautiful, beautiful...<br>
Because it's you.<br>
Why is it you?<br>
<br>
Why am I alone?<br>
I'm very close to hell,<br>
Complete loneliness.<br>
<br>
I need your affection,<br>
Even if it's fake.<br>
Still<br>
You exist<br>
And so do I.
