WITHERED FLOWERS

I possess at most
The beauty of withered flowers.
My body evokes memories...
Tortuous, tumultuous,
Happy and desperate...

No one likes me
Without first embracing
My reminiscences.

And what a calm and serene beach
My body can be
For those who discover
My soul!

I only have appeal
For those who know me.
For those who know how to search
Through me,
The countless beauties
That truth can have.
