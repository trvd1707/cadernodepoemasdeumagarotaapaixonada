                      
                        TO ADRIANA
                      
                      
                        (overdose)

                        Poor Adriana!
                        
                        So young... Only twenty years old!
                        And already so dead.
                        
                        All for a thoughtless act
                        So common at this age.
                        
                        How many of us have done
                        At least one thoughtless act
                        Up until we were twenty years old?
                        [and then regretted it...]
                        
                        But with her it all happened so fast.
                        She didn't have time to regret.
                        She didn't have time to learn
                        In all her short existence.
                        
                        Poor Adriana!
                        I don't even know if she was happy.
                        She only had time to be pretty.
                        And now,
                        Not even her beauty is left.
