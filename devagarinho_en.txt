          SLOWLY

That love began like this,
Little by little, with time spent together.
Approaches, favors granted,
Help, friendships,
Confessions, requests,
Desires and silence.

The silences gave me the certainty of the passion.
For those who are truly in love,
Abandon themselves side by side in silence,
Because the suffocating passion they feel
Prevents them from speaking.

What I found funny
Was that all that passion
Starting like that,
Slowly...
