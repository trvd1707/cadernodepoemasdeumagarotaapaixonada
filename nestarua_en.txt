                      
                        ON THIS STREET
                      
                      
                        How many woods are there
                        That are called "Solitude"?
                        
                        How many angels are there
                        That steal hearts?
                        
                        No, my love, I did not steal your heart!
                        And you did not steal mine.
                        Because neither you nor I are angels.
                        Or because we do not steal hearts.
                        
                        Why don't we steal hearts?
