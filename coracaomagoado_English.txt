                        It is very difficult to understand<br>
                        A woman's broken heart.<br>
                        It is very difficult to understand passion.<br>
                        It confuses the senses,<br>
                        It drives away sense and reason.<br>
                        It is at the same time superficial and intense.<br>
                        <br>
                        Passion is like mothballs<br>
                        In dull spirits.<br>
                        It impregnates with odors<br>
                        Our motives and destinies,<br>
                        While it evaporates<br>
                        Madly and quickly.<br>
                        </p>
