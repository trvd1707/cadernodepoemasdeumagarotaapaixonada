VISION

What you saw from the window,
People, wind, nothing, beautiful things...
What was I waiting for so long?
Could it be the joy that was lost?
If it was... Could it be?
Could it be that I found it then?
Why do my eyes shine
With such a sad light?
The reason, if there is one,
For whom could it be?
