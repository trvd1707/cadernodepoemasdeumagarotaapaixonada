                      
                        THIS HEART
                      
                      
                        My heart,
                        This one that beats inside
                        It doesn't belong to me.
                        
                        It beats for someone
                        Outside of me
                        Who can't guess my desires
                        
                        It uses my body
                        To feel him close
                        It uses my eyes
                        To see him happy.
                        
                        This heart of mine
                        That doesn't belong to me
                        It hurts from beating so much
                        For someone oblivious of me
                        
                        It contracts like a stranger
                        In my chest
                        Taking up space
                        Inside me
                        
                        Guiding my thoughts
                        And my desires
                        To you
