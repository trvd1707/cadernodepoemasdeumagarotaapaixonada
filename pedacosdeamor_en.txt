LOVE IN PIECES

Love in pieces
Are all we have left
when passion ends.

Our life changes
and love passes
like a landscape
through the train window.
Sometimes close, sometimes far,
sometimes lost in the darkness of the tunnel,
slow, stopping, running, constant.

They are pieces of love
that fill us,
they are reminiscences
of what our passions were.
