I look for a clean lake
Transparent, calm and vast
That among its secrets
Makes me glimpse
A school of golden fish

I look for where the hills are
Covered with buffalo grass
Swaying at will
In this calm breeze
That I hope to find
The soundtrack to the hills I seek

I look for solitary places
Where I can simply
Close my eyes and breathe
Listening to a long...long... music
Making my insides tremble slightly.

I look for beautiful corners
That calm me
While I wait all alone
For someone to look for me.
