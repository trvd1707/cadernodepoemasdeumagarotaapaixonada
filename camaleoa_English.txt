                        And one would say of her:<br>
                        <br>
                        - She is like a chameleon,<br>
                        Sometimes saying yes and sometimes saying no.<br>
                        <br>
                        However, I am just a child,<br>
                        Sometimes smiling and sometimes resting.<br>
                        <br>
                        You may think I am mysterious,<br>
                        Because sometimes I am simple and sometimes pompous.<br>
                        <br>
                        To you I say that I am just some random coincidence.<br>
                        <br>
                        I am not your mystery, I am your woman.<br>
