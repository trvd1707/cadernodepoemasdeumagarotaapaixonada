                        How many woods are there<br>
                        That are called "Solitude"?<br>
                        <br>
                        How many angels are there<br>
                        That steal hearts?<br>
                        <br>
                        No, my love, I did not steal your heart!<br>
                        And you did not steal mine.<br>
                        Because neither you nor I are angels.<br>
                        Or because we do not steal hearts.<br>
                        <br>
                        Why don't we steal hearts?<br></p>
