                        
                        BLUE RIBBON
                      
                      

We are each boats
That sail through biological spaces

Walk, walk. Stroll and wander unhappily
While I await you. I am a pier.
With a blue ribbon
I will tie you to my mast.

A blue ribbon bow...

You are a boat, I am a boat.
What color is the ribbon you keep for me?
What is the knot?
And I leave the boat in your lap.

If the knot comes loose,
The currents will carry you away.
On which beach will you stay?
If you went with the currents,
what wind will bring you back?

The blue ribbon swaying in the wind...
And I think: "I wish I were a sandbank",
You would be stranded and sleep there
Without the blue ribbon bow.
