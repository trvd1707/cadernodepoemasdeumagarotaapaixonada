                      
                        LOVING YOU
                      
                      
Loving you
Is something that will stay with me
forever.

Even if it's impossible to talk to you
Even if it's unlikely to look at you
Even if I always have to be silent...

Still, loving you
Is the idea with which I hope
To cozy up my old age.

Like a scarf
Fluttering my memories
in the wind.

Loving you
Sitting on a chair in the sun...

Loving you
In the loneliest moments of the night.

Forever...
Loving you...
