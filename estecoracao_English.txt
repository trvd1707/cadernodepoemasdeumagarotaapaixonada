                        THIS HEART<br><br>

                        My heart,<br>
                        This one that beats inside<br>
                        It doesn't belong to me.<br>
                        <br>
                        It beats for someone<br>
                        Outside of me<br>
                        Who can't guess my desires<br>
                        <br>
                        It uses my body<br>
                        To feel him close<br>
                        It uses my eyes<br>
                        To see him happy.<br>
                        <br>
                        This heart of mine<br>
                        That doesn't belong to me<br>
                        It hurts from beating so much<br>
                        For someone oblivious of me<br>
                        <br>
                        It contracts like a stranger<br>
                        In my chest<br>
                        Taking up space<br>
                        Inside me<br>
                        <br>
                        Guiding my thoughts<br>
                        And my desires<br>
                        To you<br>
                        </p>
                      </FONT>
