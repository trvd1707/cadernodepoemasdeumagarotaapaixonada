MISSING
I want your affection,
Even if it's fake
So I won't be alone
I want affection
And it's good that it's you
Because you're beautiful, beautiful...
Because it's you.
Why is it you?
Why am I alone?
I'm very close to hell,
Complete loneliness.
I need your affection,
Even if it's fake.
Still
You exist
And so do I.
